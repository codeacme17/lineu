# Lineu — Turn Questions into Sparks

Lineu is an AI companion for continuous thinking and learning.
It captures meaningful moments from your AI conversations and turns them into **Sparks** — ideas, insights, and directions worth revisiting.

Instead of letting valuable thoughts disappear after each chat, Lineu helps you keep them, organize them, and explore them further — directly inside your AI-powered workflow.

## ✨ What is a Spark?

A **Spark** is a captured moment of thinking.

It can be:

* A key insight
* A piece of knowledge
* An emerging idea
* A direction worth exploring further

Sparks are created directly from your AI chats and stored as structured, actionable cards.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Capture Sparks from chat

Create Sparks directly from your AI conversations using a simple command.

No context switching.
No manual note-taking.
Your thinking stays uninterrupted.

---

### 🔹 Two visual modes

Switch between two visual modes depending on how you think:

* **Focus mode** — stay in the flow while exploring
* **Review mode** — step back and reflect on your Sparks

---

### 🔹 Save, tag, and organize

Save Sparks that matter to you.

Add **tags** to categorize and filter Sparks, making it easy to revisit ideas later and build your personal knowledge map.

---

### 🔹 Dive deeper

Some Sparks deserve more attention.

Select any Spark to dive deeper — explore more detailed explanations, related ideas, and new directions, powered by AI.

A question doesn’t have to end with an answer.

---

## 🧠 How it works

1. Chat with your AI tool as usual
2. Include the **Spark command** when a moment is worth keeping
3. Lineu automatically creates a Spark card after the task completes

Your conversation continues.
The insight stays with you.

## 🌱 Philosophy

Lineu is not a productivity tool.

It’s a **thinking companion**.

We believe the most valuable part of an AI conversation isn’t just the answer —
it’s the moment where understanding begins.

Lineu exists to preserve those moments.
